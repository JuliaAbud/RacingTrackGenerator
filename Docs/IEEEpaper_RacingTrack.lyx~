\begin_layout Abstract
This document describes the project developed for the 2021 Cinvestav Guadalajara
 Introduction to Machine Learning class given by Dr.
 Andres Mendez Vazquez.
 This project explored a practical implementation of machine learning techniques
 for the use in the videogame industry.
 Mor specificcally exploring the use of ML-Agents for Procedural content
 generation of levels.
 This document describes the routes taken and decisions made to be able
 to attend to the PCG objective as well as the things learned and the possible

 Content Generation is an important part of the video game industry, as
 it allows the improvement and optimization of the production pipeline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Manually creating content is an expensive and time consuming task that can
 be minimized to allow the art team to focus on other parts of the creative
 process and letting the computer create some of the assets.
 Many Machine Learning techniques requiere of previously accumulated data
 to use as priors and learn based on this information.
 But because of the nature of videogames, specially small indie productions
 we need to make sure to generate content on the go while in the development
 stage when there are not many created assets to work with.
 The Machine Learning agents need to be allowed to learn to create the content
 by itself or with minumum help as fast as possible in the production process.

For a game in development
\series bold
 there may not be content to learn from
\series default
, because the content may not be made yet.
 In fact, not having to produce all of that content may be a prime reason
 for wanting to train a content generator in the first place.
 What would be desirable here would be a way of training a generator based
 on only a few pieces of hand-designed content, such as items, levels, or
 characters.

For this project the plan is to use Machine Learning in the Unity3D Engine
 to help in the level design process of a 
\series bold
car racing game
\series default
.
 The generated racing tracks would need to be playable, have a proper 3d
 mesh with it's collider.
 And also to consider the functionality of this types of games: it should
 fully complete a lap and close within itself, not being extremelly short
 and have a well defined main route.

\begin_layout Standard
Unity is a real-time 3D development platform that consists of a rendering
 and physics engine as well as a graphical user interface called the Unity
 Editor.
 Unity has received widespread adoption in the gaming, AEC (Architecture,
 Engineering, Construction), auto, and film industries and is used by a
 large community of game developers to make a variety of interactive simulations
, ranging from small mobile and browser-based games to high-budget console
 games and AR/VR experiences.

\begin_layout Standard
The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit

 is an open-source project that enables projects as games and simulations
 to serve as environments for training intelligent agents.
 The Unity package ML-Agents allows the use of Machine Learning techniques
 such as Reinforncement Learning or Imitation Learning.
 For reinforncement learning it is used PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization),
 and for the immitation learning is BC (Behavioral Cloning).
 ML-Agents allows using a learning environment that connects which communicates
 to a simple Python API.

Suggested routes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve the objective of generating functional racing tracks levels there
 are several constraints that needed to be considered so they ca be used
 in a racing game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we will describe possible ways encountered to solve the
 creation of the racetrack and the decision process made toward the route
 that was taken.
 This is important as it is the base to define the data that would be collected
 and fed to out ML Agent as input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Assembled pieces vs Bezier curve
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first decision to make was the way that the path creation would be handled,
 even if it was generated by a human.
 There were two routes explored for this Assembled pieces and Mesh generated
 from a bezier curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
assembled pieces
\series default
 pipeline proposes having several prefabs that can be put together with
 everything needed (mesh, the material with textures, the colliders, etc).
 This way we would have prefabs for all the possible directions, such as:
 forward, small turn, big turn, slope, etc.
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Assembled-pieces"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having 
\begin_inset Formula $4n$
\end_inset

 possible setups for each tile.
 For each piece we have four possible rotations in 
\begin_inset Formula $0°,90°,180°$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $270°$
\end_inset

 degrees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original idea for this (not implemented) process is for each one of
 the pieces to have a code from 1 to n.
 Leaving 0 for a part of the scene without any piece.
 And with the help of some cellular automata generate and fill a matrix
 that would help us to do some assembly of the tracks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with this approach is that for it to be tried out easily, all
 the pieces would need to have a predetermined size to help assemble them
 with the help of a matrix.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
bezier curve
\series default
 is a better solution that allows more freedom for the track design and
 route.
 The bezier curve can be implemented with as little as with a list of Vector3's
 describing the control points positions that will form our curve.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Bezier-curve-tool"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

.
 This way we can make sure that the track fully loops by connecting the
 last and the first control point.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This process consists on generating a random set of points as Vector3 and
 allow them to be connected.
 With this bezier curve created, we can use a tool to extrapolate the mesh
 to make it visible and use it to apply a material and a collider to allow
 it to be usable as a Racing Track.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the process that seems to give a nicer result, so it was the one
 explored with our Generator.

\begin_layout Subsection
XYZ-space vs XZ-space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another decision to make was the use of the 3D space as there is the possibility
 to actually use the three axis XYZ for our control points positions.
 Creating the racing track in a XYZ-space is far more interesting as it
 can create more complex routes but at the same time it becomes harder to
 control properly (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:1)-XYZ--space"
plural "false"
caps "false"

) as there are many more variables to consider as what qualifies as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

valid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 racing track in the classification process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The XZ-space is more simple, and is good enough for our objective as it
 can still be fully playable.
 The main specification to focus is the avoidance of overlapping sections
 in the racetrack path.
 The decision is to use just the XZ-space for the generation.

GANs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The starting idea was to use Generative Adversarial Networks to generate
 the racing tracks and developing a Generator and a Discriminator to keep
 improving the generation process.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Liu2021"

\end_inset

 suggests, the PCG of 3D map levels and 2d map level generation is usually
 approached with an Adversarial Learning technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A GAN consists of two Neural Networks competing with each other.
 The Generator G trained to minimize
\begin_inset Formula $log(1-D(G(z)))$
\end_inset

and a Discriminator D trained to maximize the probability of assigning a
 correct label.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Altough because of the nature of the GAN structure and our limitations with
 the ML-Agents algorithms, it was decided to not take the GAN route, and
 just take the generative nature of it and train it with a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exploring the Procedural Content generation (PCG) of levels using ML-Agents
 in Unity limits the problem solving to the use of reinfoncement and/or
 imitation learning.
 And because of this limitations we will adapt the general idea and using
 a Generative Neural Network trained with Reinforcement Learning and a Discrimin
ator algorithm designed for this problem (not a NN).
 By doing this we are no longer taking the Adversarial Learning route.

Reinforcement learning is commonly used to learn to play games, which makes
 sense as the problem of playing a game can easily be cast as a reinforcement
 learning problem; the action space is simply the actions available to the
 agent, and most games have a score or similar which can be used to provide
 a reward signal.
 In contrast, problems of designing games or game content are most of- ten
 cast as optimization processes, where a measure of quality is used as an
 objective function, or sometimes as supervised learning problems

ML-Agents framework uses a reinforcement learning technique called Proximal
 Policy Optimization (PPO).
 PPO uses a neural network to approximate the ideal function that maps an
 agent's observations to the best action an agent can take in a given state.

Generator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The technique used to generate our racetrack is by generating the control
 points in the bezier curve to then extrapolate a mesh to be used to render
 the path and create the collider.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data that would be used to train our generator will be a list of Vector
 3 points that provide the positions.

The objective of our discriminator is to classify if our racing track is
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

valid one
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But before trying out to do an automatic training, a manual classification
 by the user was implemented using
\series bold
 InputKey.Q
\series default
 for accepting the track and
\series bold
 InputKey.W
\series default
 for rejecting the track The objective was to quickly proove if the route
 taken with our generator was something feasible, and verify with a few
 trials if our Generator NN is actually improving before implementing an
 algorithm to do the automatic decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This test was done for around 30 minutes and with approximately 1500 episodes.
 This tiny result showed that this route was worth pursuing.

 Algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This algorithm has the objective of defining if the given path doesn't have
 any intersections within itself, this nonintersecting polygon is considered
 a 
\series bold
Simple closed path.
 
\series default
For this we verify if there exists any line segment intersection given every
 pair of segments that form our path.
 The line segment intersection problem is one of the most fundamental problems
 in computational geometry.

\begin_layout Standard
The approach for this algorithm is based in the notion of orientation of
 an ordered triplet of points in the plane.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And with the function that checks if there is an intersection for any two
 given segments, we implemented a small function that counts the amount
 of intersections in the given path comparing once each pair of segments.
 The amount of intersections is an integer that is also fed to our neural
 network.
